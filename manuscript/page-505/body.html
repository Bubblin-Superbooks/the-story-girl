<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sara Ray&rsquo;s own dreams never amounted to much. She was always in trouble of some sort&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t get her hair braided, or her shoes on the right feet. Consequently, her dream book was very monotonous. The only thing worth mentioning in the way of dreams that Sara Ray ever achieved was when she dreamed that she went up in a balloon and fell out.</p><p>&ldquo;I expected to come down with an awful thud,&rdquo; she said shuddering, &ldquo;but I lit as light as a feather and woke right up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t woke up you&rsquo;d have died,&rdquo; said Peter with a dark significance. &ldquo;If you dream of falling and DON&rsquo;T wake you DO land with a thud and it kills you. That&rsquo;s what happens to people who die in their sleep.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
