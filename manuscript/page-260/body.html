It would be more than flesh and blood could endure. I MUST hear that missionary speak. They say he was all but eaten by cannibals once. Just think how many new stories I&rsquo;d have to tell after I&rsquo;d heard him! No, I must go, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll wear my school dress and hat. THAT will be penance. Felicity, when you set the table for dinner, put the broken-handled knife for me. I hate it so.</p></div> </div>
