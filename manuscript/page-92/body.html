He just mopes about the kitchen,&rdquo; said the Story Girl anxiously. &ldquo;I went out to the barn and I saw a mouse. I had a stick in my hand and I fetched a swipe at it&mdash;so. I killed it stone dead. Then I took it in to Paddy. Will you believe it? He wouldn&rsquo;t even look at it. I&rsquo;m so worried. Uncle Roger says he needs a dose of physic. But how is he to be made take it, that&rsquo;s the question. I mixed a powder in some milk and tried to pour it down his throat while Peter held him. Just look at the scratches I got! And the milk went everywhere except down Pat&rsquo;s throat.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
