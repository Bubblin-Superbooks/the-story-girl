They were ten cents apiece, with ruled pages and mottled green covers. My own lies open beside me as I write, its yellowed pages inscribed with the visions that haunted my childish slumbers on those nights of long ago.</p><p>On the cover is pasted a lady&rsquo;s visiting card, on which is written, &ldquo;The Dream Book of Beverley King.&rdquo; Cecily had a packet of visiting cards which she was hoarding against the day when she would be grown up and could put the calling etiquette of the Family Guide into practice; but she generously gave us all one apiece for the covers of our dream books.</p></div> </div>
