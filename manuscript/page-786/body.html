I was always told that she packed it away, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So was I. But she couldn&rsquo;t have. It certainly isn&rsquo;t here. I have heard that the white plume on it cost a small fortune. Here is her black silk mantle. It seems like sacrilege to meddle with these clothes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Olivia. They must be unpacked at least. And they must all be burned since they have cut so badly. This purple cloth dress is quite good, however. It can be made over nicely, and it would become you very well, Olivia.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
