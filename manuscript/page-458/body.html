<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sunday morning broke, dull and gray. The rain had ceased, but the clouds hung dark and brooding above a world which, in its windless calm, following the spent storm-throe, seemed to us to be waiting &ldquo;till judgment spoke the doom of fate.&rdquo; We were all up early. None of us, it appeared, had slept well, and some of us not at all. The Story Girl had been among the latter, and she looked very pale and wan, with black shadows under her deep-set eyes. Peter, however, had slept soundly enough after twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve been stumping out elderberries all the afternoon it&rsquo;ll take more than the Judgment Day to keep you awake all night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But when I woke up this morning it was just awful. I&rsquo;d forgot it for a moment, and then it all came back with a rush, and I was worse scared than before.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
