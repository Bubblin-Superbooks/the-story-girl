<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Poor Sara did not have to be. She was eventually quieted down, and was as well as usual the next day; and she humbly begged Peter&rsquo;s pardon for spoiling his sermon. Peter granted it rather grumpily, and I fear that he never really quite forgave Sara for her untimely outburst. Felix, too, felt resentment against her, because he had lost the chance of preaching his sermon.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I know I wouldn&rsquo;t have got the prize, for I couldn&rsquo;t have made such an impression as Peter,&rdquo; he said to us mournfully, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to have had a chance to show what I could do. That&rsquo;s what comes of having those cry-baby girls mixed up in things. Cecily was just as scared as Sara Ray, but she&rsquo;d more sense than to show it like that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
