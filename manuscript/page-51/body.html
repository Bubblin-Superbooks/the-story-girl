I don&rsquo;t suppose there would have been a single one of us children here at all; or if we were, we would be part somebody else and that would be almost as bad. When I think it all over I can&rsquo;t feel too thankful that Grandfather and Grandmother King happened to marry each other, when there were so many other people they might have married.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
