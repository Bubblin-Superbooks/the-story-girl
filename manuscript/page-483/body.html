<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We had been at it for a fortnight, and during that time we only lived to have dreams and write them down. The Story Girl had originated the idea one evening in the rustling, rain-wet ways of the spruce wood, where we were picking gum after a day of showers. When we had picked enough, we sat down on the moss-grown stones at the end of a long arcade, where it opened out on the harvest-golden valley below us, our jaws exercising themselves vigorously on the spoil of our climbings. We were never allowed to chew gum in school or in company, but in wood and field, orchard and hayloft, such rules were in abeyance.</p><p>&ldquo;My Aunt Jane used to say it wasn&rsquo;t polite to chew gum anywhere,&rdquo; said Peter rather ruefully.</p></div> </div>
