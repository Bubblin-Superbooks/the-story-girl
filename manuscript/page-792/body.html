The Story Girl and Peter came over to stay all night with us, and we made taffy in the kitchen, which the grown-ups kindly gave over to us for that purpose.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it was very interesting to see the old chest unpacked,&rdquo; said the Story Girl as she stirred the contents of a saucepan vigorously. &ldquo;But now that it is over I believe I am sorry that it is opened. It isn&rsquo;t mysterious any longer. We know all about it now, and we can never imagine what things are in it any more.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
