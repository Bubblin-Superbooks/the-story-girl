<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;DEAR PETER:&mdash;I am awful glad you are getting better. We all felt bad when we thought you wouldn&rsquo;t, but I felt worse than the others because we hadn&rsquo;t been on very good terms lately and I had said mean things about you. I&rsquo;m sorry and, Peter, you can pray for anything you like and I won&rsquo;t ever object again. I&rsquo;m glad Uncle Alec interfered and stopped the fight. If I had licked you and you had died of the measles it would have been a dreadful thing.</p><p>&ldquo;We have all the apples in and haven&rsquo;t much to do just now and we are having lots of fun but we wish you were here to join in. I&rsquo;m a lot thinner than I was. I guess working so hard picking apples is a good thing to make you thin. The girls are all well.</p></div> </div>
