<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Aglaia had fallen in love with Glaucon just as he had with her. But she never let him suspect it for ever so long. He did not know how often she would steal up the mountain and hide behind the rocks near where the sheep pastured, to listen to Glaucon&rsquo;s beautiful music. It was very lovely music, because he was always thinking of Aglaia while he played, though he little dreamed how near him she often was.</p><p>&ldquo;But after awhile Glaucon found out that Aglaia loved him, and everything was well. Nowadays I suppose a wealthy man like Aglaia&rsquo;s father wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to let his daughter marry a hired man; but this was in the Golden Age, you know, when nothing like that mattered at all.</p></div> </div>
