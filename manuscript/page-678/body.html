But early as it was we found the Story Girl in the kitchen when we went down, sitting on Rachel Ward&rsquo;s blue chest and looking important.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Peter has the measles! He was dreadfully sick all night, and Uncle Roger had to go for the doctor. He was quite light-headed, and didn&rsquo;t know any one. Of course he&rsquo;s far too sick to be taken home, so his mother has come up to wait on him, and I&rsquo;m to live over here until he is better.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
