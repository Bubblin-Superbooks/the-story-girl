He looks just like the picture of St. John my father sent me, only he is old and his hair is white. I know you&rsquo;d like him. And even if you are going to be a Methodist it won&rsquo;t hurt you to go to the Presbyterian church. The nearest Methodist church is six miles away, at Markdale, and you can&rsquo;t attend there just now. Go to the Presbyterian church until you&rsquo;re old enough to have a horse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But s&rsquo;posen I got too fond of being Presbyterian and couldn&rsquo;t change if I wanted to?&rdquo; objected Peter.</p></div> </div>
