<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen Sara Ray since you got sick. She is awful lonesome, and Judy says she cries nearly all the time but that is nothing new. I&rsquo;m awful sorry for Sara but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not her. She is going to write you a letter too. You&rsquo;ll let me see what she puts in it, won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;d better take some Mexican Tea now. It&rsquo;s a great blood purifyer.</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to get a lovely dark blue dress for the winter. It is ever so much prettier than Sara Ray&rsquo;s brown one. Sara Ray&rsquo;s mother has no taste. The Story Girl&rsquo;s father is sending her a new red dress, and a red velvet cap from Paris. She is so fond of red. I can&rsquo;t bear it, it looks so common. Mother says I can get a velvet hood too.</p></div> </div>
