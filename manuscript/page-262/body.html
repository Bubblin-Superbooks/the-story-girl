Aunt Janet won&rsquo;t let me put pebbles in my shoes, but I&rsquo;ve put a thistle next my skin on my back and it sticks into me if I lean back the least bit. And I&rsquo;m going to work buttonholes all over this cotton. I hate working buttonholes worse than anything in the world, so I&rsquo;m going to work them all day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of working buttonholes on an old rag?&rdquo; asked Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any good. The beauty of penance is that it makes you feel uncomfortable. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do, whether it&rsquo;s useful or not, so long as it&rsquo;s nasty. Oh, I wonder how Sara is this morning.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
