I urged Janet and Alec to go to Halifax, and took the responsibility of the children while they were away, but I didn&rsquo;t know what I was letting myself in for. If anything had happened I could never have forgiven myself&mdash;though I believe it&rsquo;s beyond the power of mortal man to keep watch over the things children WILL eat. Now, you young fry, get straight off to your beds. Dan is out of danger, and you can&rsquo;t do any more good. Not that any of you have done much, except Cecily. She&rsquo;s got a head of her shoulders.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
