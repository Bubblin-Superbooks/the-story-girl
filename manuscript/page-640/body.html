<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I thought you said in your sermon, Master Peter, that people shouldn&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said they oughtn&rsquo;t to fight for fun, or for bad temper,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;This is different. I know what I&rsquo;m fighting for but I can&rsquo;t think of the word.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you mean principle,&rdquo; I suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; agreed Peter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right to fight for principle. It&rsquo;s kind of praying with your fists.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you do something to prevent them from fighting, Sara?&rdquo; pleaded Cecily, turning to the Story Girl, who was sitting on a bin, swinging her shapely bare feet to and fro.</p></div> </div>
