<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking to you, Dan King,&rdquo; retorted Felicity, &ldquo;&lsquo;Speak when you&rsquo;re spoken to, come when you&rsquo;re called.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, oh,&rdquo; wailed Cecily on the sofa. &ldquo;I WISH it would stop raining. I WISH my head would stop aching. I WISH ma had never gone away. I WISH you&rsquo;d leave Felicity alone, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish girls had some sense,&rdquo; said Dan&mdash;which brought the orgy of wishing to an end for the time. A wishing fairy might have had the time of her life in the King kitchen that morning&mdash;particularly if she were a cynically inclined fairy.</p></div> </div>
