One day the young minister was visiting the Crawfords in Markdale, when they suddenly heard old Mr. Scott&rsquo;s voice in the kitchen. The young minister turned pale as the dead, and implored Mrs. Crawford to hid him. But she couldn&rsquo;t get him out of the room, and all she could do was to hide him in the china closet. The young minister slipped into the china closet, and old Mr. Scott came into the room. He talked very nicely, and read, and prayed.</p></div> </div>
