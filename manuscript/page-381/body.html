Then we laughed until Peter got sulky.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s a fellow to know? Tommy and Adam Cowan, over at Markdale, are twins; and they&rsquo;re both cross-eyed. So I s&rsquo;posed that was what being twins meant. It&rsquo;s all very fine for you fellows to laugh. I never went to school half as much as you did; and you was brought up in Toronto, too. If you&rsquo;d worked out ever since you was seven, and just got to school in the winter, there&rsquo;d be lots of things you wouldn&rsquo;t know, either.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
