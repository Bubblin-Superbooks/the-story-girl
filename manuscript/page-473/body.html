Mrs. Frewen had been a school-teacher, and she was very particular as to how people talked, and the grammar they used. And she didn&rsquo;t like anything but refined words. One very hot day she heard Judy Pineau say she was &lsquo;all in a sweat.&rsquo; Mrs. Frewen was greatly shocked, and said, &lsquo;Judy, you shouldn&rsquo;t say that. It&rsquo;s horses that sweat. You should say you are in a perspiration.&rsquo; Well, Judy promised she&rsquo;d remember, because she liked Mrs. Frewen and was anxious to please her.</p></div> </div>
