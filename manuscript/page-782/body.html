Think of all the hopes that Rachel Ward must have put away in this chest with all her pretty things.&rdquo;</p><p>Following these, came a quaint little candlestick of blue china, and the two jugs which were to be sent to James&rsquo; wife.</p><p>&ldquo;They ARE handsome,&rdquo; said Aunt Janet rather enviously. &ldquo;They must be a hundred years old. Aunt Sara Ward gave them to Rachel, and she had them for at least fifty years. I should have thought one would have been enough for James&rsquo; wife. But of course we must do just as Rachel wished.
