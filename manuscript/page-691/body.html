<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I suppose if Peter d-d-dies he&rsquo;ll go to heaven anyhow,&rdquo; sobbed Cecily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been real good all this summer, but he isn&rsquo;t a church member.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Presbyterian, you know,&rdquo; said Felicity reassuringly. Her tone expressed her conviction that that would carry Peter through if anything would. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re none of us church members. But of course Peter couldn&rsquo;t be sent to the bad place. That would be ridiculous. What would they do with him there, when he&rsquo;s so good and polite and honest and kind?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I think he&rsquo;ll be all right, too,&rdquo; sighed Cecily, &ldquo;but you know he never did go to church and Sunday School before this summer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
