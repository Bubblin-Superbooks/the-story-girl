<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two cents more a week out of Cecily&rsquo;s egg money, meant something of a sacrifice. It inspired the rest of us. We all decided to increase our weekly contribution by a cent or so. And Peter, who had had no missionary box at all, up to this time, determined to start one.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to feel as int&rsquo;rested in missionaries as you folks do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but maybe if I begin to give something I&rsquo;ll get int&rsquo;rested. I&rsquo;ll want to know how my money&rsquo;s being spent. I won&rsquo;t be able to give much. When your father&rsquo;s run away, and your mother goes out washing, and you&rsquo;re only old enough to get fifty cents a week, you can&rsquo;t give much to the heathen. But I&rsquo;ll do the best I can. My Aunt Jane was fond of missions.</p></div> </div>
