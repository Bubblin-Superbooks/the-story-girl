<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had decided to preach on missions, as being a topic more within my grasp than abstruse theological doctrines or evangelical discourses; and, mindful of the need of making an impression, I drew a harrowing picture of the miserable plight of the heathen who in their darkness bowed down to wood and stone. Then I urged our responsibility concerning them, and meant to wind up by reciting, in a very solemn and earnest voice, the verse beginning, &ldquo;Can we whose souls are lighted.&rdquo; When I had completed my sermon I went over it very carefully again and wrote with red ink&mdash;Cecily made it for me out of an aniline dye&mdash;the word &ldquo;thump&rdquo; wherever I deemed it advisable to chastise the pulpit.</p><p>I have that sermon still, all its red thumps unfaded, lying beside my dream book; but I am not going to inflict it on my readers.</p></div> </div>
