<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pray like sixty,&rdquo; said Felix energetically.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be awful good, you know,&rdquo; warned Cecily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use praying if you&rsquo;re not good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will be easy,&rdquo; sighed Felicity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel a bit like being bad. If anything happens to Peter I feel sure I&rsquo;ll never be naughty again. I won&rsquo;t have the heart.&rdquo;</p><p>We did, indeed, pray most sincerely for Peter&rsquo;s recovery. We did not, as in the case of Paddy, &ldquo;tack it on after more important things,&rdquo; but put it in the very forefront of our petitions.</p></div> </div>
