<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ten days later, Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger went to town one evening, to remain over night, and the next day. Peter and the Story Girl were to stay at Uncle Alec&rsquo;s during their absence.</p><p>We were in the orchard at sunset, listening to the story of King Cophetua and the beggar maid&mdash;all of us, except Peter, who was hoeing turnips, and Felicity, who had gone down the hill on an errand to Mrs. Ray.</p><p>The Story Girl impersonated the beggar maid so vividly, and with such an illusion of beauty, that we did not wonder in the least at the king&rsquo;s love for her.

But now I understood it all.</p></div> </div>
