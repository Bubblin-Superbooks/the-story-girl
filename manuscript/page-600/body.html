<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Peter&rsquo;s turn came next. He did not write his sermon out. That, he averred, was too hard work. Nor did he mean to take a text.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, who ever heard of a sermon without a text?&rdquo; asked Felix blankly.</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to take a SUBJECT instead of a text,&rdquo; said Peter loftily. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to tie myself down to a text. And I&rsquo;m going to have heads in it&mdash;three heads. You hadn&rsquo;t a single head in yours,&rdquo; he added to me.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Alec says that Uncle Edward says that heads are beginning to go out of fashion,&rdquo; I said defiantly&mdash;all the more defiantly that I felt I should have had heads in my sermon. It would doubtless have made a much deeper impression. But the truth was I had forgotten all about such things.</p></div> </div>
