He turned his back on Cecily.</p><p>Cecily &ldquo;caught it&rdquo; after Uncle Alec had gone. Dan called her a tell-tale and a baby, and sneered at her until Cecily began to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand by and watch Felix and Peter pound each other all to pieces,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been such friends, and it was dreadful to see them fighting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Roger would have let them fight it out,&rdquo; said the Story Girl discontentedly. &ldquo;Uncle Roger believes in boys fighting. He says it&rsquo;s as harmless a way as any of working off their original sin. Peter and Felix wouldn&rsquo;t have been any worse friends after it. They&rsquo;d have been better friends because the praying question would have been settled.</p></div> </div>
