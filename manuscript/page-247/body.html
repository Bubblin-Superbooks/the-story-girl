Their toil and loneliness and suffering were all over and forgotten, and the bridge they had built spanned the gulf between their stars of exile.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, when the other archangels saw what had been done they flew in fear and anger to God&rsquo;s white throne, and cried to Him,</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See what these rebellious ones have done! They have built them a bridge of light across the universe, and set Thy decree of separation at naught. Do Thou, then, stretch forth Thine arm and destroy their impious work.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
