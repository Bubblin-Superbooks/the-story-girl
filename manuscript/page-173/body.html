<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the story of a braw lover who let his secret out when the whisky was above the wit, and then fell asleep while his rival was away to woo and win his lass. Did you ever hear a like story, Mr. Campbell?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Neil fiercely. &lsquo;It is laughing at me over the country side and telling that story that Donald Fraser will be doing, is it? But when I meet him it is not laughing he will be doing. Oh, no. There will be another story to tell!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t meddle with the man,&rsquo; cried Betty. &lsquo;What a state to be in because one good-looking lass likes sandy hair and gray eyes better than Highland black and blue! You have not the spirit of a wren, Neil Campbell.</p></div> </div>
