When we heard you were sick we all said nice things about you, but we were afraid it was too late, and I said if you got better I&rsquo;d tell you. It is easier to write it than to tell it out to your face. We think you are smart and polite and obliging and a great worker and a gentleman.</p><p>&ldquo;Your true friend,</p></div> </div>
