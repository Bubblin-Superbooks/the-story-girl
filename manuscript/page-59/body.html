That cup has been here for forty years, and hundreds of people have drunk from it, and it has never been broken. Aunt Julia dropped it down the well once, but they fished it up, not hurt a bit except for that little nick in the rim. I think it is bound up with the fortunes of the King family, like the Luck of Edenhall in Longfellow&rsquo;s poem. It is the last cup of Grandmother King&rsquo;s second best set. Her best set is still complete. Aunt Olivia has it. You must get her to show it to you. It&rsquo;s so pretty, with red berries all over it, and the funniest little pot-bellied cream jug. Aunt Olivia never uses it except on a family anniversary.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
