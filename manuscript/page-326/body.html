<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Dan was his own man again in the morning, though rather pale and weak; he wanted to get up, but Cecily ordered him to stay in bed. Fortunately Felicity forgot to repeat the command, so Dan did stay in bed. Cecily carried his meals to him, and read a Henty book to him all her spare time. The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself. Sara&rsquo;s intentions were good, but the pudding&mdash;well, Dan fed most of it to Paddy, who had curled himself up at the foot of the bed, giving the world assurance of a cat by his mellifluous purring.</p><p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he just a great old fellow?&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;He knows I&rsquo;m kind of sick, just as well as a human. He never pays no attention to me when I&rsquo;m well.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
