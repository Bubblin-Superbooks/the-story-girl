Peter had, in one sentence, done what my whole sermon had failed to do. He had made an impression.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall divide my sermon into three heads,&rdquo; pursued Peter. &ldquo;The first head is, what you must not do if you don&rsquo;t want to go to the bad place. The second head is, what the bad place is like&rdquo;&mdash;sensation in the audience&mdash;&ldquo;and the third head is, how to escape going there.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s a great many things you must not do, and it&rsquo;s very important to know what they are. You ought not to lose no time in finding out. In the first place you mustn&rsquo;t ever forget to mind what grown-up people tell you&mdash;that is, GOOD grown-up people.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
