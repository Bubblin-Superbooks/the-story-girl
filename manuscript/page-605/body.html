<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We sat around the Pulpit Stone and waited for Peter and Sara Ray. It was the former&rsquo;s Sunday off and he had gone home the night before, but he assured us he would be back in time to preach his sermon. Presently he arrived and mounted the granite boulder as if to the manor born. He was dressed in his new suit and I, perceiving this, felt that he had the advantage of me. When I preached I had to wear my second best suit, for it was one of Aunt Janet&rsquo;s laws that we should take our good suits off when we came home from church. There were, I saw, compensations for being a hired boy.</p><p>Peter made quite a handsome little minister, in his navy blue coat, white collar, and neatly bowed tie.</p></div> </div>
