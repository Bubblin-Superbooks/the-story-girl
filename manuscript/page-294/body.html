She presided at the head of the table with as much grace and dignity as if she had been five times twelve years old, and seemed to know by instinct just who took sugar and who took it not. She was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and was so pretty that I could hardly eat for looking at her&mdash;which is the highest compliment in a boy&rsquo;s power to pay.</p></div> </div>
