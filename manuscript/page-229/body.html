<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t, just to oblige you,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, who would have died the death before she would have gone to a &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; barefooted.</p><p>We were all rather excited over the magic lantern show which an itinerant lecturer was to give in the schoolhouse that evening. Even Felix and I, who had seen such shows galore, were interested, and the rest were quite wild. There had never been such a thing in Carlisle before. We were all going, Peter included. Peter went everywhere with us now. He was a regular attendant at church and Sunday School, where his behaviour was as irreproachable as if he had been &ldquo;raised&rdquo; in the caste of Vere de Vere. It was a feather in the Story Girl&rsquo;s cap, for she took all the credit of having started Peter on the right road.</p></div> </div>
