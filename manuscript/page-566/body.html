I wished our errand were well over.</p><p>A sudden bend in the lane brought us out to the little clearing where Peg&rsquo;s house was before we were half ready to see it. In spite of my fear I looked at it with some curiosity. It was a small, shaky building with a sagging roof, set amid a perfect jungle of weeds. To our eyes, the odd thing about it was that there was no entrance on the ground floor, as there should be in any respectable house. The only door was in the upper story, and was reached by a flight of rickety steps. There was no sign of life about the place except&mdash;sight of ill omen&mdash;a large black cat, sitting on the topmost step. We thought of Uncle Roger&rsquo;s gruesome hints. Could that black cat be Peg? Nonsense! But still&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t look like an ordinary cat.</p></div> </div>
