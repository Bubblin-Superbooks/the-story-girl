<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There were some parts of her letter I couldn&rsquo;t see through, but when the measles strike in, they leave you stupid for a spell. Anyhow, it was a fine letter, and they were all fine, and I&rsquo;m awful glad I have so many nice friends, even if I am only a hired boy. Perhaps I&rsquo;d never have found it out if the measles hadn&rsquo;t struck in. So I&rsquo;m glad they did but I hope they never will again.</p><p>&ldquo;Your obedient servant,</p></div> </div>
