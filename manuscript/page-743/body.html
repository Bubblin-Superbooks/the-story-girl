<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I did not keep a copy of my own letter, and I have forgotten everything that was in it, except the first sentence, in which I told Peter I was awful glad he was getting better.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s delight on receiving our letters knew no bounds. He insisted on answering them and his letter, painstakingly disinfected, was duly delivered to us. Aunt Olivia had written it at his dictation, which was a gain, as far as spelling and punctuation went. But Peter&rsquo;s individuality seemed merged and lost in Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s big, dashing script. Not until the Story Girl read the letter to us in the granary by jack-o-lantern light, in a mimicry of Peter&rsquo;s very voice, did we savour the real bouquet of it.</p></div> </div>
