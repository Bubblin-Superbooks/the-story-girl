<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Felix was very indignant&mdash;and aggrieved as well.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why God should answer Peter&rsquo;s prayers instead of mine,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone to church and Sunday School all my life, and Peter never went till this summer. It isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Felix, don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; said Cecily, shocked. &ldquo;God MUST be fair. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I believe is the reason. Peter prays three times a day regular&mdash;in the morning and at dinner time and at night&mdash;and besides that, any time through the day when he happens to think of it, he just prays, standing up. Did you ever hear of such goings-on?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
