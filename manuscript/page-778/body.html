<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Story Girl came over early in the morning, and Sara Ray, to whom faithful Cecily had sent word, was also on hand. Felicity did not approve of this.</p><p>&ldquo;Sara Ray isn&rsquo;t any relation to our family,&rdquo; she scolded to Cecily, &ldquo;and she has no right to be present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a particular friend of mine,&rdquo; said Cecily with dignity. &ldquo;We have her in everything, and it would hurt her feelings dreadfully to be left out of this. Peter is no relation either, but he is going to be here when we open it, so why shouldn&rsquo;t Sara?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
