<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are still praying for me, Cecily, for you can&rsquo;t trust the measles. And I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re keeping you know what for me. I don&rsquo;t believe anything will happen to you if you do take the measles; but if anything does I&rsquo;d like that little red book of yours, The Safe Compass, just to remember you by. It&rsquo;s such a good book to read on Sundays. It is interesting and religious, too. So is the Bible. I hadn&rsquo;t quite finished the Bible before I took the measles, but ma is reading the last chapters to me. There&rsquo;s an awful lot in that book. I can&rsquo;t understand the whole of it, since I&rsquo;m only a hired boy, but some parts are real easy.</p></div> </div>
