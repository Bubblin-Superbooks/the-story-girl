If I do take the measles and anything happens to me Felicity is to have my cherry vase. I&rsquo;d rather give it to the Story Girl, but Dan says it ought to be kept in the family, even if Felicity is a crank. I haven&rsquo;t anything else valuable, since I gave Sara Ray my forget-me-not jug, but if you would like anything I&rsquo;ve got let me know and I&rsquo;ll leave instructions for you to have it. The Story Girl has told us some splendid stories lately. I wish I was clever like her. Ma says it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re not clever as long as you are good, but I am not even very good.</p></div> </div>
