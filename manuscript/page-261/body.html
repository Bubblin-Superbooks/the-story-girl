It&rsquo;s such dreadful tasting stuff&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a good blood purifier, so Aunt Janet can&rsquo;t object to it.&rdquo;</p><p>The Story Girl carried out her self-imposed penance fully. All day she sat in the kitchen and worked buttonholes, subsisting on bread and water and Mexican Tea.</p><p>Felicity did a mean thing. She went to work and made little raisin pies, right there in the kitchen before the Story Girl. The smell of raisin pies is something to tempt an anchorite; and the Story Girl was exceedingly fond of them. Felicity ate two in her very presence, and then brought the rest out to us in the orchard. The Story Girl could see us through the window, carousing without stint on raisin pies and Uncle Edward&rsquo;s cherries. But she worked on at her buttonholes.</p></div> </div>
