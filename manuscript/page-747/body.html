<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful glad you have such a good opinion of me. I don&rsquo;t deserve it, but after this I&rsquo;ll try to. I can&rsquo;t tell you how I feel about all your kindness. I&rsquo;m like the fellow the Story Girl wrote about who couldn&rsquo;t get it out. I have the picture the Story Girl gave me for my sermon on the wall at the foot of my bed. I like to look at it, it looks so much like Aunt Jane.</p><p>&ldquo;Felix, I&rsquo;ve given up praying that I&rsquo;d be the only one to eat the bitter apples, and I&rsquo;ll never pray for anything like that again. It was a horrid mean prayer. I didn&rsquo;t know it then, but after the measles struck in I found out it was. Aunt Jane wouldn&rsquo;t have liked it. After this I&rsquo;m going to pray prayers I needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of.</p></div> </div>
