The Story Girl never held the Family Guide in such reverence as did Felicity and Cecily. They pored over the &ldquo;etiquette column&rdquo; every week, and could have told you on demand, just exactly what kind of gloves should be worn at a wedding, what you should say when introducing or being introduced, and how you ought to look when your best young man came to see you.</p></div> </div>
