She had put on a new personality like a garment, and that personality was a venomous, evil, loathly thing. I would rather have died than have touched the slim, brown wrist on which she supported herself. The light in her narrowed orbs was the cold, merciless gleam of the serpent&rsquo;s eye. I felt frightened of this unholy creature who had suddenly come in our dear Story Girl&rsquo;s place.</p><p>When the tale ended there was a brief silence. Then Aunt Janet said severely, but with a sigh of relief,</p><p>&ldquo;Little girls shouldn&rsquo;t tell such horrible stories.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
