It SAYS it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s picture,&rdquo; said Felix.</p><p>&ldquo;It is nothing of the sort,&rdquo; said Mr. Marwood indignantly. &ldquo;There is no such thing as a picture of God, Felix. No human being knows what he looks like&mdash;no human being CAN know. We should not even try to think what He looks like. But, Felix, you may be sure that God is infinitely more beautiful and loving and tender and kind than anything we can imagine of Him. Never believe anything else, my boy. As for this&mdash;this SACRILEGE&mdash;take it and burn it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
