<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Felicity determined she would never let another dream get away from her in such a fashion; and the next time she wakened in the night&mdash;having dreamed that she was dead and buried&mdash;she promptly arose, lighted a candle, and proceeded to write the dream down then and there. While so employed she contrived to upset the candle and set fire to her nightgown&mdash;a brand-new one, trimmed with any quantity of crocheted lace. A huge hole was burned in it, and when Aunt Janet discovered it she lifted up her voice with no uncertain sound. Felicity had never received a sharper scolding. But she took it very philosophically. She was used to her mother&rsquo;s bitter tongue, and she was not unduly sensitive.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I saved my dream,&rdquo; she said placidly.</p></div> </div>
