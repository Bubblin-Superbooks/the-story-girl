<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We took a drink from the blue cup and then went to find our birthday trees. We were rather disappointed to find them quite large, sturdy ones. It seemed to us that they should still be in the sapling stage corresponding to our boyhood.</p><p>&ldquo;Your apples are lovely to eat,&rdquo; the Story Girl said to me, &ldquo;but Felix&rsquo;s are only good for pies. Those two big trees behind them are the twins&rsquo; trees&mdash;my mother and Uncle Felix, you know. The apples are so dead sweet that nobody but us children and the French boys can eat them. And that tall, slender tree over there, with the branches all growing straight up, is a seedling that came up of itself, and NOBODY can eat its apples, they are so sour and bitter. Even the pigs won&rsquo;t eat them. Aunt Janet tried to make pies of them once, because she said she hated to see them going to waste. But she never tried again.</p></div> </div>
