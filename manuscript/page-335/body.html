Would YOU forgive James Forbes if he had called YOU Johnny?&rdquo; demanded Cecily.</p><p>&ldquo;I know a story about Martin Forbes&rsquo; grandfather,&rdquo; said the Story Girl. &ldquo;Long ago they didn&rsquo;t have any choir in the Carlisle church&mdash;just a precentor you know. But at last they got a choir, and Andrew McPherson was to sing bass in it. Old Mr. Forbes hadn&rsquo;t gone to church for years, because he was so rheumatic, but he went the first Sunday the choir sang, because he had never heard any one sing bass, and wanted to hear what it was like. Grandfather King asked him what he thought of the choir. Mr. Forbes said it was &lsquo;verra guid,&rsquo; but as for Andrew&rsquo;s bass, &lsquo;there was nae bass aboot it&mdash;it was just a bur-r-r-r the hale time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
