And we never had to turn HIS speeches inside out to discover their meaning.</p><p>The social life of juvenile Carlisle centred in the day and Sunday Schools. We were especially interested in our Sunday School, for we were fortunate enough to be assigned to a teacher who made our lessons so interesting that we no longer regarded Sunday School attendance as a disagreeable weekly duty; but instead looked forward to it with pleasure, and tried to carry out our teacher&rsquo;s gentle precepts&mdash;at least on Mondays and Tuesdays. I am afraid the remembrance grew a little dim the rest of the week.</p></div> </div>
