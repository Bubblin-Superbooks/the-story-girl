When Sara Ray smiled&mdash;and she did not waste her smiles&mdash;she was rather pretty in a plaintive, apologetic way. A dimple or two came into sight, and she had very nice teeth&mdash;small and white, like the traditional row of pearls.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, just look,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here are three dollars&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to give it all to the library fund. I had a letter to-day from Uncle Arthur in Winnipeg, and he sent me three dollars. He said I was to use it ANY way I liked, so ma couldn&rsquo;t refuse to let me give it to the fund. She thinks it&rsquo;s an awful waste, but she always goes by what Uncle Arthur says. Oh, I&rsquo;ve prayed so hard that some money might come some way, and now it has. See what praying does!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
