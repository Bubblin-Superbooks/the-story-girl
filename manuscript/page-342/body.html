<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We rose in a body and rushed towards the house. In the yard we encountered Dan, emerging from the fir wood and champing the fatal berries with unrepentant relish.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan King, do you want to commit suicide?&rdquo; demanded the Story Girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, Dan,&rdquo; I expostulated. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t do this. Think how sick you were last night and all the trouble you made for everybody. Don&rsquo;t eat any more, there&rsquo;s a good chap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve et all I want. They taste fine. I don&rsquo;t believe it was them made me sick.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
