<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I know another story about Mr. Scott,&rdquo; said the Story Girl. &ldquo;Not long after he was married his wife wasn&rsquo;t quite ready for church one morning when it was time to go. So, just to teach her a lesson, he drove off alone, and left her to walk all the way&mdash;it was nearly two miles&mdash;in the heat and dust. She took it very quietly. It&rsquo;s the best way, I guess, when you&rsquo;re married to a man like old Mr. Scott. But just a few Sundays after wasn&rsquo;t he late himself! I suppose Mrs. Scott thought that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander, for she slipped out and drove off to church as he had done. Old Mr. Scott finally arrived at the church, pretty hot and dusty, and in none too good a temper. He went into the pulpit, leaned over it and looked at his wife, sitting calmly in her pew at the side.</p></div> </div>
