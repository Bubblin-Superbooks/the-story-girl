<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;DEAR PETER:&mdash;Oh, how glad I am that you are getting better! Those days when we thought you wouldn&rsquo;t were the hardest of my whole life. It seemed too dreadful to be true that perhaps you would die. And then when we heard you were going to get better that seemed too good to be true. Oh, Peter, hurry up and get well, for we are having such good times and we miss you so much. I have coaxed Uncle Alec not to burn his potato stalks till you are well, because I remember how you always liked to see the potato stalks burn. Uncle Alec consented, though Aunt Janet said it was high time they were burned. Uncle Roger burned his last night and it was such fun.</p></div> </div>
