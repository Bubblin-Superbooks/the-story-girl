At sunset, Felicity, Cecily, and Sara Ray, Dan, Felix, and I were in the orchard, sitting on the cool grasses at the base of the Pulpit Stone. In the west was a field of crocus sky over which pale cloud blossoms were scattered.</p><p>Uncle Roger had gone to the station to meet the travellers, and the dining-room table was spread with a feast of fat things.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a jolly week, take it all round,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad the grown-ups are coming back to-night, especially Uncle Alec.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
