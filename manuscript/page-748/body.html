<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;DEAR EVERYBODY, BUT ESPECIALLY FELICITY:&mdash;I was awful glad to get your letters. It makes you real important to be sick, but the time seems awful long when you&rsquo;re getting better. Your letters were all great, but I liked Felicity&rsquo;s best, and next to hers the Story Girl&rsquo;s. Felicity, it will be awful good of you to send me things to eat and the rosebud plate. I&rsquo;ll be awful careful of it. I hope you won&rsquo;t catch the measles, for they are not nice, especially when they strike in, but you would look all right, even if you did have red spots on your face. I would like to try the Mexican Tea, because you want me to, but mother says no, she doesn&rsquo;t believe in it, and Burtons Bitters are a great deal healthier. If I was you I would get the velvet hood all right. The heathen live in warm countries so they don&rsquo;t want hoods.</p></div> </div>
