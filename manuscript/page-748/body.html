<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Sara Ray, I don&rsquo;t know what it feels like to be going to die because I didn&rsquo;t know I was going to die till I got better. Mother says I was luny most of the time after they struck in. It was just because they struck in I was luny. I ain&rsquo;t luny naturally, Felicity. I will do what you asked in your postscript, Sara, although it will be hard.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Peg Bowen didn&rsquo;t catch you, Dan. Maybe she bewitched me that night we were at her place, and that is why the measles struck in. I&rsquo;m awful glad Mr. King is going to leave the potato stalks until I get well, and I&rsquo;m obliged to the Story Girl for coaxing him. I guess she will find out about Alice yet.</p></div> </div>
