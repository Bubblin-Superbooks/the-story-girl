<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Sara Stanley, have you taken leave of your senses?&rdquo; demanded Aunt Janet. &ldquo;What do you mean by putting on such a rig! Don&rsquo;t you know I have company to tea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and that is just why I put it on, Aunt Janet. I want to mortify the flesh&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;mortify&rsquo; you, if I catch you showing yourself to the Millwards like that, my girl! Go right home and dress yourself decently&mdash;or eat your supper in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p><p>The Story Girl chose the latter alternative. She was highly indignant. I verily believe that to sit at the dining-room table, in that shabby, outgrown dress, conscious of looking her ugliest, and eating only bread and water before the critical Millwards would have been positive bliss to her.</p></div> </div>
