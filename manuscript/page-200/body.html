<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The captain of the Fanny is the hero of my story. His name was Alan Dunbar, and he was young and handsome. Heroes always are, you know, but Aunt Louisa says he really was. And he was in love&mdash;wildly in love,&mdash;with Margaret Grant. Margaret was as beautiful as a dream, with soft blue eyes and clouds of golden hair; and she loved Alan Dunbar just as much as he loved her. But her parents were bitterly opposed to him, and they had forbidden Margaret to see him or speak to him. They hadn&rsquo;t anything against him as a MAN, but they didn&rsquo;t want her to throw herself away on a sailor.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, when Alan Dunbar knew that he must go to California in the Fanny he was in despair. He felt that he could NEVER go so far away for so long and leave his Margaret behind. And Margaret felt that she could never let him go. I know EXACTLY how she felt.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
