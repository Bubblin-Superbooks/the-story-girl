<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He came into the orchard to write a poem, and he fell asleep with his head on a bench that used to be under grandfather&rsquo;s tree. Then Great-Aunt Edith came into the orchard. She was not a Great-Aunt then, of course. She was only eighteen, with red lips and black, black hair and eyes. They say she was always full of mischief. She had been away and had just come home, and she didn&rsquo;t know about the Poet. But when she saw him, sleeping there, she thought he was a cousin they had been expecting from Scotland. And she tiptoed up&mdash;so&mdash;and bent over&mdash;so&mdash;and kissed his cheek. Then he opened his big blue eyes and looked up into Edith&rsquo;s face. She blushed as red as a rose, for she knew she had done a dreadful thing. This could not be her cousin from Scotland. She knew, for he had written so to her, that he had eyes as black as her own.</p></div> </div>
