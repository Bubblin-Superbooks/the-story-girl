<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Beverley King,&rdquo; suddenly cried Felicity, who had been peering into a pot, &ldquo;YOU&rsquo;VE GONE AND PUT THE TURNIPS ON TO BOIL WHOLE JUST LIKE POTATOES!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; I cried, in an agony of shame.</p><p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; but Felicity had already whisked the turnips out, and was slicing them, while all the others were laughing at me. I had added a tradition on my own account to the family archives.</p><p>Uncle Roger roared when he heard it; and he roared again at night over Peter&rsquo;s account of Felix attempting to milk a cow. Felix had previously acquired the knack of extracting milk from the udder. But he had never before tried to &ldquo;milk a whole cow.&rdquo; He did not get on well; the cow tramped on his foot, and finally upset the bucket.</p></div> </div>
