This was more than he had expected. Neil hadn&rsquo;t been courting Nancy very long, and Donald never dreamed he would propose to her QUITE so soon.</p><p>&ldquo;At first Donald didn&rsquo;t know what to do. He felt sure deep down in his heart, that Nancy liked HIM. She was very shy and modest, but you know a girl can let a man see she likes him without going out of her way. But Donald knew that if Neil proposed first he would have the best chance. Neil was rich and the Shermans were poor, and old Elias Sherman would have the most to say in the matter. If he told Nancy she must take Neil Campbell she would never dream of disobeying him. Old Elias Sherman was a man who had to be obeyed. But if Nancy had only promised some one else first her father would not make her break her word.</p></div> </div>
