But it took the Story Girl to make us realize just how dreadful it was and what a terrible risk we had run years before we, or our parents either, had existed.</p><p>&ldquo;Who lives over there?&rdquo; I asked, pointing to a house across the fields.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that belongs to the Awkward Man. His name is Jasper Dale, but everybody calls him the Awkward Man. And they do say he writes poetry. He calls his place Golden Milestone. I know why, because I&rsquo;ve read Longfellow&rsquo;s poems. He never goes into society because he is so awkward. The girls laugh at him and he doesn&rsquo;t like it. I know a story about him and I&rsquo;ll tell it to you sometime.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
