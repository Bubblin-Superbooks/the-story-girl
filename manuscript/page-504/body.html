I&rsquo;ve seen Aunt Jane look at me just like that woman looks at her baby. Ma never looks so. Poor ma is too busy washing. I wish I could dream of my Aunt Jane. I never do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dream of the dead, you&rsquo;ll hear of the living,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Felix oracularly.</p></div> </div>
