<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Story Girl curtsied until her silken skirts swept the floor. Then she flung herself in her chair and looked at Mr. Campbell, flushed, triumphant, daring.</p><p>The story was old to us. It had once been published in a Charlottetown paper, and we had read in Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s scrapbook, where the Story Girl had learned it. But we had listened entranced. I have written down the bare words of the story, as she told it; but I can never reproduce the charm and colour and spirit she infused into it. It LIVED for us. Donald and Neil, Nancy and Betty, were there in that room with us. We saw the flashes of expression on their faces, we heard their voices, angry or tender, mocking or merry, in Lowland and Highland accent. We realized all the mingled coquetry and feeling and defiance and archness in Betty Sherman&rsquo;s daring speech. We had even forgotten all about Mr. Campbell.</p></div> </div>
