<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Just down the hill. You can&rsquo;t see the house for the spruce bush. Sara is a nice girl. She&rsquo;s only eleven, and her mother is dreadfully strict. She never allows Sara to read a single story. JUST you fancy! Sara&rsquo;s conscience is always troubling her for doing things she&rsquo;s sure her mother won&rsquo;t approve, but it never prevents her from doing them. It only spoils her fun. Uncle Roger says that a mother who won&rsquo;t let you do anything, and a conscience that won&rsquo;t let you enjoy anything is an awful combination, and he doesn&rsquo;t wonder Sara is pale and thin and nervous. But, between you and me, I believe the real reason is that her mother doesn&rsquo;t give her half enough to eat. Not that she&rsquo;s mean, you know&mdash;but she thinks it isn&rsquo;t healthy for children to eat much, or anything but certain things. Isn&rsquo;t it fortunate we weren&rsquo;t born into that sort of a family?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
