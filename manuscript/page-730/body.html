You should of heard the girls crying.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all getting their winter finery now and the talk about it would make you sick. The Story Girl is getting hers from Paris and Felicity is awful jealous though she pretends she isn&rsquo;t. I can see through her.</p><p>&ldquo;Kitt Mar was up here Thursday to see the girls. She&rsquo;s had the measles so she isn&rsquo;t scared. She&rsquo;s a great girl to laugh. I like a girl that laughs, don&rsquo;t you?</p></div> </div>
