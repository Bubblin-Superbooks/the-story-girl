I was coming through the gap in the hedge, and I saw somebody in blue standing under Uncle Alec&rsquo;s tree. How my heart beat! My hair should have stood up on end with terror but it didn&rsquo;t. I felt to see, and it was lying down quite flat. But it was only a visitor after all. I don&rsquo;t know whether I was glad or disappointed. I don&rsquo;t think it would be a pleasant experience to see the ghost. But after I had seen it think what a heroine I would be!</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter, what do you think? I have got acquainted with the Awkward Man at last. I never thought it would be so easy.</p></div> </div>
