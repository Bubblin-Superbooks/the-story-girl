And the door was shut and the sound kind o&rsquo; muffled. It&rsquo;s all very fine to say you would have known what it was, but I don&rsquo;t believe you would.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; said the Story Girl honestly. &ldquo;I thought it WAS a bell when I heard it, and the door open, too. Let us be fair, Felicity.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
