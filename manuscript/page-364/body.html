You must have imagined it, Peter. Or else Uncle Roger is trying to fool us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your Uncle Roger went to Markdale right after milking,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;He locked up the house and gave me the key. There wasn&rsquo;t a soul in it then, that I&rsquo;m sure of. I druv the cows to the pasture, and I got back about fifteen minutes ago. I set down on the front door steps for a moment, and all at once I heard a bell ring in the house eight times. I tell you I was skeered. I made a bolt for the orchard&mdash;and you won&rsquo;t catch me going near that house till your Uncle Roger comes home.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
