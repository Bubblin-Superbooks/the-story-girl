<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As I turn the pages and glance over the (&mdash;&mdash;) records, each one beginning, &ldquo;Last night I dreamed,&rdquo; the past comes very vividly back to me. I see that bowery orchard, shining in memory with a soft glow of beauty&mdash;&ldquo;the light that never was on land or sea,&rdquo;&mdash;where we sat on those September evenings and wrote down our dreams, when the cares of the day were over and there was nothing to interfere with the pleasing throes of composition. Peter&mdash;Dan&mdash;Felix&mdash;Cecily&mdash;Felicity&mdash;Sara Ray&mdash;the Story Girl&mdash;they are all around me once more, in the sweet-scented, fading grasses, each with open dream books and pencil in hand, now writing busily, now staring fixedly into space in search of some elusive word or phrase which might best describe the indescribable. I hear their laughing voices, I see their bright, unclouded eyes.</p></div> </div>
