<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Were I you, I would show Donald Fraser that I could woo and win a lass as speedily as any Lowlander of them all; that I would! There&rsquo;s many a girl would gladly say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; for your asking. And here stands one! Why not marry ME, Neil Campbell? Folks say I&rsquo;m as bonny as Nan&mdash;and I could love you as well as Nan loves her Donald&mdash;ay, and ten times better!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you suppose the Campbell did? Why, just the thing he ought to have done. He took Betty at her word on the spot; and there was a double wedding soon after. And it is said that Neil and Betty were the happiest couple in the world&mdash;happier even than Donald and Nancy. So all was well because it ended well!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
