<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I could never understand why Felix took Peter&rsquo;s success in the Ordeal of Bitter Apples so much to heart. He had not felt very keenly over the matter of the sermons, and certainly the mere fact that Peter could eat sour apples without making faces did not cast any reflection on the honour or ability of the other competitors. But to Felix everything suddenly became flat, stale, and unprofitable, because Peter continued to hold the championship of bitter apples. It haunted his waking hours and obsessed his nights. I heard him talking in his sleep about it. If anything could have made him thin the way he worried over this matter would have done it.</p><p>For myself, I cared not a groat. I had wished to be successful in the sermon contest, and felt sore whenever I thought of my failure.</p></div> </div>
