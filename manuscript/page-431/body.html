I&rsquo;ll just have to be satisfied with making up my mind to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist. I wanted to wait till I got old enough to make out what was the difference between them, but I&rsquo;ll have to chance it now. I guess I&rsquo;ll be a Presbyterian, &lsquo;cause I want to be like the rest of you. Yes, I&rsquo;ll be a Presbyterian.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
