<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It is easy to go to California now; but it was a very different matter then. There were no railroads across the land, as there are now, and if you wanted to go to California you had to go in a sailing vessel, all the way around Cape Horn. It was a long and dangerous journey; and sometimes it took over six months. When you got there you had no way of sending word home again except by the same plan. It might be over a year before your people at home heard a word about you&mdash;and fancy what their feelings would be!</p><p>&ldquo;But these young men didn&rsquo;t think of these things; they were led on by a golden vision. They made all their arrangements, and they chartered the brig Fanny to take them to California.</p></div> </div>
