Peter was by way of skulking shamefacedly past into the shadows; but the Story Girl&rsquo;s brief, bitter anger had vanished.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait for me, Peter,&rdquo; she called.</p><p>She went over to him and held out her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I forgive you,&rdquo; she said graciously.</p><p>Felix and I felt that it would really be worth while to offend her, just to be forgiven in such an adorable voice.
