<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Felicity,&rdquo; said the Story Girl reproachfully, &ldquo;what have you been doing to Peter? He&rsquo;s up there sulking in the granary, and he won&rsquo;t come down, and he says it&rsquo;s your fault. You must have hurt his feelings dreadfully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about his feelings,&rdquo; said Felicity, with an angry toss of her shining head, &ldquo;but I guess I made his ears tingle all right. I boxed them both good and hard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Felicity! What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he tried to kiss me, that&rsquo;s what for!&rdquo; said Felicity, turning very red. &ldquo;As if I would let a hired boy kiss me! I guess Master Peter won&rsquo;t try anything like that again in a hurry.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
