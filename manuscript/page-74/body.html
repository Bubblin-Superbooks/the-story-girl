<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But you can hardly ever coax Peter to be the poet&mdash;except when Felicity is Edith&mdash;and Dan is so obliging that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is Peter like?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter is splendid. His mother lives on the Markdale road and washes for a living. Peter&rsquo;s father ran away and left them when Peter was only three years old. He has never come back, and they don&rsquo;t know whether he is alive or dead. Isn&rsquo;t that a nice way to behave to your family? Peter has worked for his board ever since he was six. Uncle Roger sends him to school, and pays him wages in summer. We all like Peter, except Felicity.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
