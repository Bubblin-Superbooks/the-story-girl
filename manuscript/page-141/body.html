But I&rsquo;ll tell you all I do know. I call it &lsquo;The Mystery of the Golden Milestone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t believe that story is true,&rdquo; said Felicity. &ldquo;I believe Mrs. Griggs was just romancing. She DOES romance, mother says.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; but I don&rsquo;t believe she could ever have thought of such a thing as this herself, so I believe it must be true,&rdquo; said the Story Girl. &ldquo;Anyway, this is the story, boys. You know the Awkward Man has lived alone ever since his mother died, ten years ago.</p></div> </div>
