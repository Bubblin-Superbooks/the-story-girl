<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Peter took Dan and me aside one evening, as we were on our way to the orchard with our dream books, saying significantly that he wanted our advice. Accordingly, we went round to the spruce wood, where the girls would not see us to the rousing of their curiosity, and then Peter told us of his dilemma.</p><p>&ldquo;Last night I dreamed I was in church,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought it was full of people, and I walked up the aisle to your pew and set down, as unconcerned as a pig on ice. And then I found that I hadn&rsquo;t a stitch of clothes on&mdash;NOT ONE BLESSED STITCH. Now&rdquo;&mdash;Peter dropped his voice&mdash;&ldquo;what is bothering me is this&mdash;would it be proper to tell a dream like that before the girls?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
