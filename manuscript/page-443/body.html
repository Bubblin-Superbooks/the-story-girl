If he was trying to hoax us there would have been a twinkle in them. He can never help that. You know he would think it a great joke to frighten us like this. It&rsquo;s really dreadful to have no grown-ups you can depend on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We could depend on father if he was here,&rdquo; said Dan stoutly. &ldquo;HE&rsquo;D tell us the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He would tell us what he THOUGHT was true, Dan, but he couldn&rsquo;t KNOW. He&rsquo;s not such a well-educated man as the editor of the Enterprise. No, there&rsquo;s nothing to do but wait and see.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
