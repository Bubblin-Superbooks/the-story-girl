<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was a woman&rsquo;s picture above the bookcase. Mrs. Griggs says she thinks it was a coloured photograph, but she didn&rsquo;t know who it was. Anyway, it was a very pretty girl. But the most amazing thing of all was that A WOMAN&rsquo;S DRESS was hanging over a chair by the table. Mrs. Griggs says it NEVER belonged to Jasper Dale&rsquo;s mother, for she thought it a sin to wear anything but print and drugget; and this dress was of PALE BLUE silk. Besides that, there was a pair of blue satin slippers on the floor beside it&mdash;HIGH-HEELED slippers. And on the fly-leaves of the books the name &lsquo;Alice&rsquo; was written. Now, there never was an Alice in the Dale connection and nobody ever heard of the Awkward Man having a sweetheart. There, isn&rsquo;t that a lovely mystery?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
