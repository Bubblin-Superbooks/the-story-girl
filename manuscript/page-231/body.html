She likes Cecily. She doesn&rsquo;t like either Felicity or me, so it would only make matters worse for us to try.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;s gone to town&mdash;pa and her went this afternoon&mdash;and they&rsquo;re not coming back till to-morrow. There&rsquo;s nobody home but Judy Pineau and me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you just go to the show anyhow? Your mother won&rsquo;t ever know, if you coax Judy to hold her tongue.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
