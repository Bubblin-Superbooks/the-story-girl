Nothing like THAT could happen in Prince Edward Island. But if there HAD been beautiful wives hanging up by their hair all round the walls I don&rsquo;t believe Mrs. Griggs could have been much more astonished. The room had never been furnished in his mother&rsquo;s time, but now it was ELEGANTLY furnished, though Mrs. Griggs says SHE doesn&rsquo;t know when or how that furniture was brought there. She says she never saw a room like it in a country farmhouse. It was like a bed-room and sitting-room combined. The floor was covered with a carpet like green velvet. There were fine lace curtains at the windows and beautiful pictures on the walls. There was a little white bed, and a dressing-table, a bookcase full of books, a stand with a work basket on it, and a rocking-chair.</p></div> </div>
