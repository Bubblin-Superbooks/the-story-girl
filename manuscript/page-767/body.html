He never was known to laugh again, or even smile. He became a very religious man, which was a good thing, but he was dreadfully gloomy and thought everything pleasant sinful. He wouldn&rsquo;t even eat any more than was actually necessary to keep him alive. Uncle Roger says that if he had been a Roman Catholic he would have become a monk, but, as he was a Presbyterian, all he could do was to turn into a crank.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but your Uncle Roger was never clapped on the shoulder and called brother by the devil,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;If he had, he mightn&rsquo;t have been so precious jolly afterwards himself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
