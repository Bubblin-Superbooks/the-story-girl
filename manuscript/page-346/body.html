<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Felicity King, if you don&rsquo;t watch out you&rsquo;ll grow up into the sort of woman who drives her husband to drink,&rdquo; said Uncle Roger gravely.</p><p>&ldquo;How could I tell Dan would act so like a mule!&rdquo; cried Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;Get off to bed, every one of you. It&rsquo;s a thankful man I&rsquo;ll be when your father and mother come home. The wretched bachelor who undertakes to look after a houseful of children like you is to be pitied. Nobody will ever catch me doing it again. Felicity, is there anything fit to eat in the pantry?&rdquo;</p><p>That last question was the most unkindest cut of all. Felicity could have forgiven Uncle Roger anything but that. It really was unpardonable. She confided to me as we climbed the stairs that she hated Uncle Roger.</p></div> </div>
