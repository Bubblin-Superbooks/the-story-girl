<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Pat is splendid. He has never had a sick spell since that bad one. I would send him over to be company for you, but Aunt Janet says no, because he might carry the measles back. I don&rsquo;t see how he could, but we must obey Aunt Janet. She is very good to us all, but I know she does not approve of me. She says I&rsquo;m my father&rsquo;s own child. I know that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything complimentary because she looked so queer when she saw that I had heard her, but I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m like father. I had a splendid letter from him this week, with the darlingest pictures in it. He is painting a new picture which is going to make him famous. I wonder what Aunt Janet will say then.</p></div> </div>
