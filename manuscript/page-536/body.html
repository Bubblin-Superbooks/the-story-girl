<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go down to the Pulpit Stone and I&rsquo;ll tell you a story I know,&rdquo; said the Story Girl.</p><p>We went&mdash;and straightway drank of the waters of forgetfulness. In a brief space we were laughing right merrily, no longer remembering our wrongs at the hands of those cruel grown-ups. Our laughter echoed back from the barns and the spruce grove, as if elfin denizens of upper air were sharing in our mirth.</p><p>Presently, also, the laughter of the grown-ups mingled with ours. Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger, Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec, came strolling through the orchard and joined our circle, as they sometimes did when the toil of the day was over, and the magic time &lsquo;twixt light and dark brought truce of care and labour. &lsquo;Twas then we liked our grown-ups best, for then they seemed half children again.</p></div> </div>
