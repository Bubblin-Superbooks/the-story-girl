That came from praying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rdquo; said Cecily tremulously. &ldquo;Dan said it was no use for me to bother praying about it. He said if they COULDN&rsquo;T speak God might do something, but when they just WOULDN&rsquo;T it wasn&rsquo;t likely He would interfere. Dan does say such queer things. I&rsquo;m so afraid he&rsquo;s going to grow up just like Uncle Robert Ward, who never goes to church, and doesn&rsquo;t believe more than half the Bible is true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which half does he believe is true?&rdquo; I inquired with unholy curiosity.</p></div> </div>
