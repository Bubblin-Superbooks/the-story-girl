Tell us the story,&rdquo; I said curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;It is about Mrs. John Martin&rsquo;s uncle at Markdale,&rdquo; said the Story Girl. &ldquo;I heard Uncle Roger telling it the other night. He didn&rsquo;t know I was sitting on the cellar hatch outside the window, or I don&rsquo;t suppose he would have told it. Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s name was William Cowan, and he has been dead for twenty years; but sixty years ago he was a young man, and a very wild, wicked young man. He did everything bad he could think of, and never went to church, and he laughed at everything religious, even the devil. He didn&rsquo;t believe there was a devil at all.</p></div> </div>
