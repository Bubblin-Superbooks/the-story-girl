Wouldn&rsquo;t it be awful funny if any one wrote a story about a fat hero&mdash;or about one with too big a mouth?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what a man LOOKS like,&rdquo; I said, feeling that Felix and Dan were catching it rather too hotly. &ldquo;He must be a good sort of chap and DO heaps of things.
