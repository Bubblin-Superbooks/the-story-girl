<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There was a Warder of the bridge, a god, dark and stern and sorrowful. And to him Odin gave command that he should open the gate and allow his followers to cross the Rainbow Bridge, that they might drink of the fountain of life beyond. And the Warder set open the gate.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pass on and drink of the fountain,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;To all who taste of it shall immortality be given. But only to that one who shall drink of it first shall be permitted to walk at Odin&rsquo;s right hand forever.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then the company passed through in great haste, all fired with a desire to be the first to drink of the fountain and win so marvellous a boon. Last of all came Ving. He had lingered behind to pluck a thorn from the foot of a beggar child he had met on the highway, and he had not heard the Warder&rsquo;s words.</p></div> </div>
