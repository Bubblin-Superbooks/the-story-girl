<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;An Irishman who lived at Markdale had a little pig,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he gave it a pailful of mush. The pig ate the whole pailful, and then the Irishman put the pig IN the pail, and it didn&rsquo;t fill more than half the pail. Now, how was that, when it held a whole pailful of mush?&rdquo;</p><p>This seemed to be a rather unanswerable kind of conundrum. We discussed the problem as we roamed the wood, and Dan and Peter almost quarrelled over it, Dan maintaining that the thing was impossible, and Peter being of the opinion that the mush was somehow &ldquo;made thicker&rdquo; in the process of being eaten, and so took up less room. During the discussion we came out to the fence of the hill pasture where grew the &ldquo;bad berry&rdquo; bushes.</p></div> </div>
