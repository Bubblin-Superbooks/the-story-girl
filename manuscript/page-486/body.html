She was one of those women who are always saying &lsquo;I told you so&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take notice, Felicity,&rdquo; said Dan aside.</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;And she was very stubborn. Soon after she was married she and her husband quarrelled about an apple tree they had planted in their orchard. The label was lost. He said it was a Fameuse and she declared it was a Yellow Transparent. They fought over it till the neighbours came out to listen. Finally he got so angry that he told her to shut up.</p></div> </div>
