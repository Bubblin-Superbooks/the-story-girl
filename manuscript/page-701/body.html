<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had never heard any one cry so, with dreadful, rending sobs. I was used to hearing girls cry. It was as much Sara Ray&rsquo;s normal state as any other, and even Felicity and Cecily availed themselves occasionally of the privilege of sex. But I had never heard any girl cry like this. It gave me the same unpleasant sensation which I had felt one time when I had seen my father cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Sara, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said gently, patting her convulsed shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;You ARE a queer girl,&rdquo; said Felicity&mdash;more tolerantly than usual however&mdash;&ldquo;you never cried a speck when you thought Peter was going to die&mdash;and now when he is going to get better you cry like that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
