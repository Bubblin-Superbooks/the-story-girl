I just feel sick, I was so frightened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if he&rsquo;d laugh once and have it done with it,&rdquo; said Felicity bitterly. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll laugh at us for a year, and tell the story to every soul that comes to the place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame him for that,&rdquo; said the Story Girl. &ldquo;I shall tell it, too. I don&rsquo;t care if the joke is as much on myself as any one. A story is a story, no matter who it&rsquo;s on. But it IS hateful to be laughed at&mdash;and grown-ups always do it. I never will when I&rsquo;m grown up. I&rsquo;ll remember better.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
