Her crowning achievement was a rich little plum cake, on the white frosting of which the words &ldquo;Welcome Back&rdquo; were lettered in pink candies. This was put before Peter&rsquo;s place, and almost overcame him.</p><p>&ldquo;To think that you&rsquo;d go to so much trouble for me!&rdquo; he said, with a glance of adoring gratitude at Felicity. Felicity got all the gratitude, although the Story Girl had originated the idea and seeded the raisins and beaten the eggs, while Cecily had trudged all the way to Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s little shop below the church to buy the pink candies. But that is the way of the world.</p></div> </div>
