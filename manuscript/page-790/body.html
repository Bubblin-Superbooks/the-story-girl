<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The Story Girl got the blue candlestick, and Felicity and Cecily each got a pink and gold vase. Even Sara Ray was made happy by the gift of a little china plate, with a loudly coloured picture of Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh in the middle of it. Moses wore a scarlet cloak, while Aaron disported himself in bright blue. Pharaoh was arrayed in yellow. The plate had a scalloped border with a wreath of green leaves around it.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall never use it to eat off,&rdquo; said Sara rapturously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it up on the parlour mantelpiece.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see much use in having a plate just for ornament,&rdquo; said Felicity.</p></div> </div>
