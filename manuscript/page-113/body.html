<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>White marble tablets, ornamented with weeping willow trees, marked where Grandfather and Grandmother King were buried, and a single shaft of red Scotch granite stood between the graves of Aunt Felicity and Uncle Felix. The Story Girl lingered to lay a bunch of wild violets, misty blue and faintly sweet, on her mother&rsquo;s grave; and then she read aloud the verse on the stone.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The tones of her voice brought out the poignant and immortal beauty and pathos of that wonderful old lament. The girls wiped their eyes; and we boys felt as if we might have done so, too, had nobody been looking. What better epitaph could any one wish than to have it said that he was lovely and pleasant in his life?</p></div> </div>
