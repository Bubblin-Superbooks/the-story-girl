<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose your Aunt Jane knew all the rules of etiquette,&rdquo; said Felicity, designing to crush Peter with a big word, borrowed from the Family Guide. But Peter was not to be so crushed. He had in him a certain toughness of fibre, that would have been proof against a whole dictionary.</p><p>&ldquo;She did, too,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;My Aunt Jane was a real lady, even if she was only a Craig. She knew all those rules and she kept them when there was nobody round to see her, just the same as when any one was. And she was smart. If father had had half her git-up-and-git I wouldn&rsquo;t be a hired boy to-day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
