If the world doesn&rsquo;t come to an end I&rsquo;ll tell you the story of Ruth next Sunday&mdash;or look here! I&rsquo;ll tell it anyhow. That&rsquo;s a promise. Wherever we are next Sunday I&rsquo;ll tell you about Ruth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, you wouldn&rsquo;t tell stories in heaven,&rdquo; said Cecily, in a very timid voice.</p></div> </div>
