<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And who lives in that other house?&rdquo; asked Felix, looking over the westering valley where a little gray roof was visible among the trees.</p><p>&ldquo;Old Peg Bowen. She&rsquo;s very queer. She lives there with a lot of pet animals in winter, and in summer she roams over the country and begs her meals. They say she is crazy. People have always tried to frighten us children into good behaviour by telling us that Peg Bowen would catch us if we didn&rsquo;t behave. I&rsquo;m not so frightened of her as I once was, but I don&rsquo;t think I would like to be caught by her. Sara Ray is dreadfully scared of her. Peter Craig says she is a witch and that he bets she&rsquo;s at the bottom of it when the butter won&rsquo;t come. But I don&rsquo;t believe THAT. Witches are so scarce nowadays. There may be some somewhere in the world, but it&rsquo;s not likely there are any here right in Prince Edward Island.</p></div> </div>
