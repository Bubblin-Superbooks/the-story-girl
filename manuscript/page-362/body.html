But she would tell us nothing more.</p><p>When the jelly cookies were all eaten it was high time to be moving homeward, for when the dark comes down there are more comfortable places than a rustling maple wood and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring. When we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical, mystical time of &ldquo;between lights.&rdquo; Off to the west was a daffodil glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets, and Grandfather King&rsquo;s huge willow rose up against it like a rounded mountain of foliage. In the east, above the maple woods, was a silvery sheen that hinted the moonrise. But the orchard was a place of shadows and mysterious sounds.</p></div> </div>
