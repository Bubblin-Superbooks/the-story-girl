<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Are there any Methodist heathen? I s&rsquo;pose I ought to give my box to them, rather than to Presbyterian heathen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only after they&rsquo;re converted that they&rsquo;re anything in particular,&rdquo; said Felicity. &ldquo;Before that, they&rsquo;re just plain heathen. But if you want your money to go to a Methodist missionary you can give it to the Methodist minister at Markdale. I guess the Presbyterians can get along without it, and look after their own heathen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just smell Mrs. Sampson&rsquo;s flowers,&rdquo; said Cecily, as we passed a trim white paling close to the road, over which blew odours sweeter than the perfume of Araby&rsquo;s shore. &ldquo;Her roses are all out and that bed of Sweet William is a sight by daylight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
