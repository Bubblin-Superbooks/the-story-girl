<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I must candidly say that her tone savoured strongly of a last resort; but this was owing more to early training than to any lack of faith on Cecily&rsquo;s part. She knew and we knew, that prayer was a solemn rite, not to be lightly held, nor degraded to common uses. Felicity voiced this conviction when she said,</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it would be right to pray about a cat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know why not,&rdquo; retorted Cecily, &ldquo;God made Paddy just as much as He made you, Felicity King, though perhaps He didn&rsquo;t go to so much trouble. And I&rsquo;m sure He&rsquo;s abler to help him than Peg Bowen. Anyhow, I&rsquo;m going to pray for Pat with all my might and main, and I&rsquo;d like to see you try to stop me. Of course I won&rsquo;t mix it up with more important things.</p></div> </div>
