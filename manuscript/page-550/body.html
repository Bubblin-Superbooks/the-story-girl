But she isn&rsquo;t a witch&mdash;that&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right. But wait till I tell you. When Peg Bowen was leaving Pat stretched out on the steps. She tramped on his tail. You know Pat doesn&rsquo;t like to have his tail meddled with. He slewed himself round and clawed her bare foot. If you&rsquo;d just seen the look she gave him you&rsquo;d know whether she was a witch or not. And she went off down the lane, muttering and throwing her hands round, just like she did in Lem Hill&rsquo;s cow pasture. She put a spell on Pat, that&rsquo;s what she did. He was sick the next morning.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
