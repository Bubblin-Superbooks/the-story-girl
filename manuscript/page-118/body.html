Whatever made you act so crazy, Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t mean to. And I wanted to laugh twice before that and DIDN&rsquo;T. It was the Story Girl&rsquo;s stories made me want to laugh, so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair for her to be mad at me. She hadn&rsquo;t ought to tell me stories about people if she don&rsquo;t want me to laugh when I see them. When I looked at Samuel Ward I thought of him getting up in meeting one night, and praying that he might be guided in his upsetting and downrising.</p></div> </div>
