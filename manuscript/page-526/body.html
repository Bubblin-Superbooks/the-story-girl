Aunt Olivia knew nothing about it, of course. She permitted them only a plain, wholesome lunch at bed-time. But during the day the Story Girl would smuggle upstairs various tidbits from the pantry, putting half in Peter&rsquo;s room and half in her own; and the result was these visions which had been our despair.</p><p>&ldquo;Last night I ate a piece of mince pie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and a lot of pickles, and two grape jelly tarts. But I guess I overdid it, because I got real sick and couldn&rsquo;t sleep at all, so of course I didn&rsquo;t have any dreams.</p></div> </div>
