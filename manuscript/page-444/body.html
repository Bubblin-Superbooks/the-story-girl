I wanted to go also, but the girls protested.</p><p>&ldquo;YOU must stay and keep us cheered up,&rdquo; implored Felicity. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m ever going to put in the afternoon. I promised Kitty Marr that I&rsquo;d go down and spend it with her, but I can&rsquo;t now. And I can&rsquo;t knit any at my lace. I&rsquo;d just keep thinking, &lsquo;What is the use? Perhaps it&rsquo;ll all be burned up to-morrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>So I stayed with the girls, and a miserable afternoon we had of it. The Story Girl again and again declared that she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; but when we asked her to tell a story, she evaded it with a flimsy excuse.</p></div> </div>
