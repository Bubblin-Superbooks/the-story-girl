I wanted to see the picture as soon as you did.&rdquo;</p><p>We waited and watched at the window. The valley was full of mist, and the rain was coming down in slanting lines over the tops of the spruces. But as we waited the clouds broke away and the sun came out flashingly; the drops on the spruce boughs glittered like diamonds.</p></div> </div>
