There are times when you can&rsquo;t help crying. But I hide then. Sara just goes and cries in public.&rdquo;</p><p>The lachrymose Sara presently joined us and we discovered the cause of her tears to be the doleful fact that her mother had forbidden her to go to the magic lantern show that night. We all showed the sympathy we felt.</p><p>&ldquo;She SAID yesterday you could go,&rdquo; said the Story Girl indignantly. &ldquo;Why has she changed her mind?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
