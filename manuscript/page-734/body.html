<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We had a call from Peg Bowen yesterday. You should of seen the Story Girl hustling Pat out of the way, for all she says she don&rsquo;t believe he was bewitched. Peg had your rheumatism ring on and the Story Girl&rsquo;s blue beads and Sara Ray&rsquo;s lace soed across the front of her dress. She wanted some tobacco and some pickles. Ma gave her some pickles but said we didn&rsquo;t have no tobacco and Peg went off mad but I guess she wouldn&rsquo;t bewitch anything on account of the pickles.</p><p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t any hand to write letters so I guess I&rsquo;ll stop. Hope you&rsquo;ll be out soon. DAN.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
