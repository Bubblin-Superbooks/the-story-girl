<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go and begin stumping out the elderberry pasture this afternoon,&rdquo; said Peter dolefully. &ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s a tough job. Mr. Roger might wait for cool weather before he sets people to stumping out elderberries, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell him so?&rdquo; asked Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my business to tell him things,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hired to do what I&rsquo;m told, and I do it. But I can have my own opinion all the same. It&rsquo;s going to be a broiling hot day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
