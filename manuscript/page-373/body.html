As he did so, clear and sweet, rang out ten bell-like chimes.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I heard,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bell!&rdquo;</p><p>We had to wait until Uncle Roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation. We thought he never WOULD stop.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Grandfather King&rsquo;s old clock striking,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he was able to speak. &ldquo;Sammy Prott came along after tea, when you were away to the forge, Peter, and I gave him permission to clean the old clock. He had it going merrily in no time. And now it has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
