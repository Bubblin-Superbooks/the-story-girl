Her hair was like a skein of golden silk, and her eyes were as blue as the gulf water when the sun breaks out after a storm. Donald felt more nervous than ever. But he knew he must make the most of his chance. He might not see Nancy alone again before Neil came. He caught her hand and stammered out,</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nan, lass, I love you. You may think &lsquo;tis a hasty wooing, but that&rsquo;s a story I can tell you later maybe. I know well I&rsquo;m not worthy of you, but if true love could make a man worthy there&rsquo;d be none before me. Will you have me, Nan?&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
