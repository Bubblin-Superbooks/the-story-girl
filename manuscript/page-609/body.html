<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But how are you going to tell who are the good grown-up people?&rdquo; asked Felix suddenly, forgetting that he was in church.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that is easy,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;You can always just FEEL who is good and who isn&rsquo;t. And you mustn&rsquo;t tell lies and you mustn&rsquo;t murder any one. You must be specially careful not to murder any one. You might be forgiven for telling lies, if you was real sorry for them, but if you murdered any one it would be pretty hard to get forgiven, so you&rsquo;d better be on the safe side. And you mustn&rsquo;t commit suicide, because if you did that you wouldn&rsquo;t have any chance of repenting it; and you mustn&rsquo;t forget to say your prayers and you mustn&rsquo;t quarrel with your sister.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
