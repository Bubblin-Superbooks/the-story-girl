<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be rather tired growing except the spruces and chrysanthemums in Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s garden. The sunshine is so thick and yellow and lazy, and the crickets sing all day long. The birds are nearly all gone and most of the maple leaves have fallen.</p><p>&ldquo;Just to make you laugh I&rsquo;ll write you a little story I heard Uncle Alec telling last night. It was about Elder Frewen&rsquo;s grandfather taking a pair of rope reins to lead a piano home. Everybody laughed except Aunt Janet. Old Mr. Frewen was HER grandfather too, and she wouldn&rsquo;t laugh. One day when old Mr. Frewen was a young man of eighteen his father came home and said, &lsquo;Sandy, I bought a piano at Simon Ward&rsquo;s sale to-day. You&rsquo;re to go to-morrow and bring it home.&rsquo; So next day Sandy started off on horseback with a pair of rope reins to lead the piano home. He thought it was some kind of livestock.</p></div> </div>
