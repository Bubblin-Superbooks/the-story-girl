<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Midway up the open space in its heart we met Peter; and if ever a boy was given over to sheer terror that boy was Peter. His face was as white as a sunburned face could be, and his eyes were brimmed with panic.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what is the matter?&rdquo; cried Cecily.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;SOMETHING&mdash;in the house, RINGING A BELL,&rdquo; said Peter, in a shaking voice. Not the Story Girl herself could have invested that &ldquo;something&rdquo; with more of creepy horror. We all drew close together. I felt a crinkly feeling along my back which I had never known before. If Peter had not been so manifestly frightened we might have thought he was trying to &ldquo;pass a joke&rdquo; on us. But such abject terror as his could not be counterfeited.</p></div> </div>
