<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There is no chance for me to have any horrid dreams,&rdquo; lamented Sara Ray, &ldquo;because ma won&rsquo;t let me having anything at all to eat before I go to bed. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hide something away through the day as we do?&rdquo; asked Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Sara shook her fawn-coloured head mournfully. &ldquo;Ma always keeps the pantry locked, for fear Judy Pineau will treat her friends.&rdquo;</p><p>For a week we ate unlawful lunches and dreamed dreams after our own hearts&mdash;and, I regret to say, bickered and squabbled incessantly throughout the daytime, for our digestions went out of order and our tempers followed suit. Even the Story Girl and I had a fight&mdash;something that had never happened before. Peter was the only one who kept his normal poise. Nothing could upset that boy&rsquo;s stomach.</p></div> </div>
