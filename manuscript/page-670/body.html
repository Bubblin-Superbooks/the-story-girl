<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Is that a conundrum?&rdquo; asked Cecily cautiously. &ldquo;If it is I won&rsquo;t try to guess the reason. I never can guess conundrums.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a conundrum,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact. They do&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a good reason for it.&rdquo;</p><p>We stopped picking apples, sat down on the grass, and tried to reason it out&mdash;with the exception of Dan, who declared that he knew there was a catch somewhere and he wasn&rsquo;t going to be caught. The rest of us could not see where any catch could exist, since Felix solemnly vowed, &lsquo;cross his heart, white sheep did eat more than black. We argued over it seriously, but finally had to give it up.</p></div> </div>
