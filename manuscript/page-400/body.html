<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There was a young shepherd named Glaucon&mdash;a very handsome young shepherd&mdash;who lived in a little village called Thebes. It became a very great and famous city afterwards, but at this time it was only a little village, very quiet and simple. Too quiet for Glaucon&rsquo;s liking. He grew tired of it, and he thought he would like to go away from home and see something of the world. So he took his knapsack and his shepherd&rsquo;s crook, and wandered away until he came to Thessaly. That is the land of the gods&rsquo; hill, you know. The name of the hill was Olympus. But it has nothing to do with this story. This happened on another mountain&mdash;Mount Pelion.</p></div> </div>
