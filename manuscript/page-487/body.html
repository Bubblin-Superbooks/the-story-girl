I suppose she thought she would teach him manners, for would you believe it? That woman did shut up, and never spoke one single word to her husband for five years.

She said, &lsquo;I told you so.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And did she talk to him after that as usual?&rdquo; asked Sara Ray.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she was just the same as she used to be,&rdquo; said the Story Girl wearily. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t belong to the story.
