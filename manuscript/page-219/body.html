I bought a box from him for&mdash;for&mdash;something. He said he wasn&rsquo;t going to sell any of it to anybody else. Did he sell any to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; I said in disgust&mdash;for I was beginning to understand that Billy and his magic seed were arrant frauds.</p><p>&ldquo;What for? YOUR mouth is a decent size,&rdquo; said Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Mouth? It had nothing to do with my mouth! He said it would make me grow tall. And it hasn&rsquo;t&mdash;not an inch! I don&rsquo;t see what you wanted it for! You are tall enough.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
