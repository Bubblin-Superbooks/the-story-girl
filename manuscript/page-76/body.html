I am NOT going to dig them up this year to see if they have sprouted. It is bad for them. I shall try to cultivate patience, no matter how long they are coming up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to help mother plant the vegetable garden to-day,&rdquo; said Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I never like the vegetable garden,&rdquo; said the Story Girl. &ldquo;Except when I am hungry. Then I DO like to go and look at the nice little rows of onions and beets. But I love a flower garden. I think I could be always good if I lived in a garden all the time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
