We were much taken aback to find that Mrs. Ray came to the gate instead of Judy, and rather sourly demanded what we were yelling about. When she heard our news, however, she had the decency to say she was glad, and to promise she would convey the good tidings to Sara&mdash;&ldquo;who is already in bed, where all children of her age should be,&rdquo; added Mrs. Ray severely.</p><p>WE had no intention of going to bed for a good two hours yet.</p></div> </div>
