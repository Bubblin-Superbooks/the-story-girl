We ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard, just as Uncle Roger alighted at the front door. He stared at us in the moonlight.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you tormented any one into eating more bad berries, Felicity?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Roger, don&rsquo;t go in,&rdquo; implored Felicity seriously. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something dreadful in there&mdash;something that rings a bell. Peter heard it. Don&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use asking the meaning of this, I suppose,&rdquo; said Uncle Roger with the calm of despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gave up trying to fathom you young ones. Peter, where&rsquo;s the key? What yarn have you been telling?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
