<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rdquo; Every family festival was commemorated in like fashion, and every beloved visitor who spent a night under their roof was expected to plant a tree in the orchard. So it came to pass that every tree in it was a fair green monument to some love or delight of the vanished years. And each grandchild had its tree, there, also, set out by grandfather when the tidings of its birth reached him; not always an apple tree&mdash;perhaps it was a plum, or cherry or pear. But it was always known by the name of the person for whom, or by whom, it was planted; and Felix and I knew as much about &ldquo;Aunt Felicity&rsquo;s pears,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aunt Julia&rsquo;s cherries,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Uncle Alec&rsquo;s apples,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Rev. Mr. Scott&rsquo;s plums,&rdquo; as if we had been born and bred among them.</p></div> </div>
