<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Felix sits on the right of the Story Girl, fat and stodgy, grimly in earnest even over dreams. He writes with his knees stuck up to form a writing-desk, and he always frowns fiercely the whole time.</p><p>Dan, like Peter, writes lying down flat, but with his back towards us; and he has a dismal habit of groaning aloud, writhing his whole body, and digging his toes into the grass, when he cannot turn a sentence to suit him.</p><p>Sara Ray is at his left. There is seldom anything to be said of Sara except to tell where she is. Like Tennyson&rsquo;s Maud, in one respect at least, Sara is splendidly null.</p></div> </div>
