<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What a sulky, sulky lot of little people,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia, going away across the yard, holding her pretty dress up from the dewy grass.</p><p>Peter resolved to stay all night with us, too, not troubling himself about anybody&rsquo;s permission. When we went to bed it was settling down for a stormy night, and the rain was streaming wetly on the roof, as if the world, like Sara Ray, were weeping because its end was so near. Nobody forgot or hurried over his prayers that night. We would dearly have loved to leave the candle burning, but Aunt Janet&rsquo;s decree regarding this was as inexorable as any of Mede and Persia. Out the candle must go; and we lay there, quaking, with the wild rain streaming down on the roof above us, and the voices of the storm wailing through the writhing spruce trees.</p></div> </div>
