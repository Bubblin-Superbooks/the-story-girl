<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My story is about Mrs. Dunbar and the Captain of the FANNY,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, settling herself comfortably on a bough, with her brown head against a gnarled trunk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad and beautiful&mdash;and true. I do love to tell stories that I know really happened. Mrs. Dunbar lives next door to Aunt Louisa in town. She is so sweet. You wouldn&rsquo;t think to look at her that she had a tragedy in her life, but she has. Aunt Louisa told me the tale. It all happened long, long ago. Interesting things like this all did happen long ago, it seems to me. They never seem to happen now. This was in &lsquo;49, when people were rushing to the gold fields in California. It was just like a fever, Aunt Louisa says. People took it, right here on the Island; and a number of young men determined they would go to California.</p></div> </div>
