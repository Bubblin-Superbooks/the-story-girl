<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When we grew tired of our sport we went to the windward side of the field and perched ourselves on the high pole fence that skirted a dark spruce wood, full of strange, furtive sounds. Over us was a great, dark sky, blossoming with silver stars, and all around lay dusky, mysterious reaches of meadow and wood in the soft, empurpled night. Away to the east a shimmering silveryness beneath a palace of aerial cloud foretokened moonrise. But directly before us the potato field, with its wreathing smoke and sullen flames, the gigantic shadow of Uncle Alec crossing and recrossing it, reminded us of Peter&rsquo;s famous description of the bad place, and probably suggested the Story Girl&rsquo;s remark.</p><p>&ldquo;I know a story,&rdquo; she said, infusing just the right shade of weirdness into her voice, &ldquo;about a man who saw the devil. Now, what&rsquo;s the matter, Felicity?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
