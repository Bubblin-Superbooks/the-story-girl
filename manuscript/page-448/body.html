<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Cecily pestered Aunt Janet&rsquo;s life out, asking repeatedly, &ldquo;Ma, will you be washing Monday?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ma, will you be going to prayer meeting Tuesday night?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ma, will you be preserving raspberries next week?&rdquo; and various similar questions. It was a huge comfort to her that Aunt Janet always said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; as if there could be no question about it.</p><p>Sara Ray cried until I wondered how one small head could contain all the tears she shed. But I do not believe she was half as much frightened as disappointed that she had no white dress. In mid-afternoon Cecily came downstairs with her forget-me-not jug in her hand&mdash;a dainty bit of china, wreathed with dark blue forget-me-nots, which Cecily prized highly, and in which she always kept her toothbrush.</p></div> </div>
