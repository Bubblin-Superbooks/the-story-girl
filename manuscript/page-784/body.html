And the dear, old-fashioned pillow-slips with buttons on them!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here are a dozen handkerchiefs,&rdquo; said Aunt Janet. &ldquo;Look at the initial in the corner of each. Rachel learned that stitch from a nun in Montreal. It looks as if it was woven into the material.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here are her quilts,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia. &ldquo;Yes, there is the blue and white counterpane Grandmother Ward gave her&mdash;and the Rising Sun quilt her Aunt Nancy made for her&mdash;and the braided rug. The colours are not faded one bit. I want that rug, Janet.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
