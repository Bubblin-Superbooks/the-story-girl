<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The rest of us ate our apples, or carried them to school where we bartered them for such treasures as our schoolmates possessed and we coveted.</p><p>There was a dusky, little, pear-shaped apple&mdash;from one of Uncle Stephen&rsquo;s trees&mdash;which was our favourite; and next to it a delicious, juicy yellow apple from Aunt Louisa&rsquo;s tree. We were also fond of the big sweet apples; we used to throw them up in the air and let them fall on the ground until they were bruised and battered to the bursting point. Then we sucked on the juice; sweeter was it than the nectar drunk by blissful gods on the Thessalian hill.</p></div> </div>
