She looks far too sober in that picture.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She has a beautiful neck and bust,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia critically.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyhow, Will Montague was really handsome,&rdquo; said the Story Girl.</p><p>&ldquo;A handsome rogue,&rdquo; growled Uncle Alec. &ldquo;I never liked him.
