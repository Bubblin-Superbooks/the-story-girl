<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Pat was with us, of course, prowling about stealthily, or making frantic, bootless leaps at the swallows. A cat in a hayloft is a beautiful example of the eternal fitness of things. We had not heard of this fitness then, but we all felt that Paddy was in his own place in a hayloft.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it is very vain to talk about anything you have yourself being beautiful,&rdquo; said Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not a bit vain,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, with entire truthfulness. &ldquo;It is not vanity to know your own good points. It would just be stupidity if you didn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s only vanity when you get puffed up about them. I am not a bit pretty. My only good points are my hair and eyes and feet. So I think it&rsquo;s real mean that one of them has to be covered up the most of the time. I&rsquo;m always glad when it gets warm enough to go barefooted. But, when I grow up they&rsquo;ll have to covered all the time. It IS mean.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
