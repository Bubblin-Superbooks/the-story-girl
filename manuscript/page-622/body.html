<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; And I heard Uncle Alec tell a story once about being nearly frightened to death when he was a little boy, by a minister preaching on the end of the world; and he said, &lsquo;That was something like a sermon. You don&rsquo;t hear such sermons nowadays.&rsquo; But when Peter preaches just such a sermon, it&rsquo;s a very different story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder we can&rsquo;t understand the grown-ups,&rdquo; said the Story Girl indignantly, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ve never been grown-up ourselves. But THEY have been children, and I don&rsquo;t see why they can&rsquo;t understand us. Of course, perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t have had the contest on Sundays. But all the same I think it&rsquo;s mean of Uncle Alec to be so cross. Oh, I do hope poor Sara won&rsquo;t have to be taken to the asylum.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
