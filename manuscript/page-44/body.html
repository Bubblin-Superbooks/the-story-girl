<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I got up early this morning, though, for I felt sure you would be up early, too, and that you&rsquo;d like to have me tell you about things. I can tell things so much better than Felicity or Cecily. Do you think Felicity is VERY pretty?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the prettiest girl I ever saw,&rdquo; I said enthusiastically, remembering that Felicity had called me handsome.</p><p>&ldquo;The boys all think so,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, not, I fancied, quite well pleased. &ldquo;And I suppose she is. She is a splendid cook, too, though she is only twelve. I can&rsquo;t cook. I am trying to learn, but I don&rsquo;t make much progress. Aunt Olivia says I haven&rsquo;t enough natural gumption ever to be a cook; but I&rsquo;d love to be able to make as good cakes and pies as Felicity can make. But then, Felicity is stupid. It&rsquo;s not ill-natured of me to say that.</p></div> </div>
