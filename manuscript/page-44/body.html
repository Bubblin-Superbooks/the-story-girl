<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I like Uncle Roger,&rdquo; said the Story Girl meditatively. &ldquo;He is big and jolly. But he teases people too much. You ask him a serious question and you get a ridiculous answer. He hardly ever scolds or gets cross, though, and THAT is something. He is an old bachelor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he ever mean to get married?&rdquo; asked Felix.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Aunt Olivia wishes he would, because she&rsquo;s tired keeping house for him, and she wants to go to Aunt Julia in California. But she says he&rsquo;ll never get married, because he is looking for perfection, and when he finds her she won&rsquo;t have HIM.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
