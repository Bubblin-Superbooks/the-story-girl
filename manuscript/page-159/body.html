<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Neil Campbell, who was Highland Scotch and lived down at Berwick, was courting Nancy Sherman, too; and, what was far worse, Nancy&rsquo;s father favoured him, because he was a richer man than Donald Fraser. But Donald was not going to show all he thought&mdash;Scotch people never do&mdash;and he pretended to be very glad to see Neil and made him heartily welcome.</p><p>&ldquo;Neil sat down by the roaring fire, looking quite well satisfied with himself. It was ten miles from Berwick to the bay shore, and a call at a half way house was just the thing. Then Donald brought out the whisky. They always did that eighty years ago, you know. If you were a woman, you could give your visitors a dish of tea; but if you were a man and did not offer them a &lsquo;taste&rsquo; of whisky, you were thought either very mean or very ignorant.</p></div> </div>
