<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Billy was taller than any boy of his age in Carlisle, and he assured me it all came from taking magic seed.</p><p>&ldquo;I was a regular runt before I begun,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and look at me now. I got it from Peg Bowen. She&rsquo;s a witch, you know. I wouldn&rsquo;t go near her again for a bushel of magic seed. It was an awful experience. I haven&rsquo;t much left, but I guess I&rsquo;ve enough to do me till I&rsquo;m as tall as I want to be. You must take a pinch of the seed every three hours, walking backward, and you must never tell a soul you&rsquo;re taking it, or it won&rsquo;t work. I wouldn&rsquo;t spare any of it to any one but you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
