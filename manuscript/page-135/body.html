Felix worked well, although he did not like weeding&mdash;&ldquo;fat boys never do,&rdquo; Felicity informed him. Felix pretended not to hear her, but I knew he did, because his ears grew red. Felix&rsquo;s face never blushed, but his ears always gave him away. As for Felicity, she did not say things like that out of malice prepense. It never occurred to her that Felix did not like to be called fat.</p></div> </div>
