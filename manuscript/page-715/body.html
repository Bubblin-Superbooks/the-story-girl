<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;DEAR PETER:&mdash;Aunt Olivia says for us all to write a compound letter to cheer you up. We are all awful glad you are getting better. It gave us an awful scare when we heard you were going to die. But you will soon be all right and able to get out again. Be careful you don&rsquo;t catch cold. I am going to bake some nice things for you and send them over, now that the doctor says you can eat them. And I&rsquo;ll send you my rosebud plate to eat off of. I&rsquo;m only lending it, you know, not giving it. I let very few people use it because it is my greatest treasure. Mind you don&rsquo;t break it. Aunt Olivia must always wash it, not your mother.</p></div> </div>
