Plainly, there was something out of the common about the beastie!</p><p>In a tense, breathless silence the Story Girl placed our parcels on the lowest step, and laid her letter on the top of the pile.

She was a tall, sinewy old woman, wearing a short, ragged, drugget skirt which reached scantly below her knees, a scarlet print blouse, and a man&rsquo;s hat. Her feet, arms, and neck were bare, and she had a battered old clay pipe in her mouth.

She was scowling, and her flashing black eyes held no friendly light.</p></div> </div>
