Life seemed very colourless without her, and even Felicity admitted that it was lonesome. But three days after her departure Felix told us something on the way home from school which lent some spice to existence immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; he said in a very solemn, yet excited, tone. &ldquo;Jerry Cowan told me at recess this afternoon that he HAD SEEN A PICTURE OF GOD&mdash;that he has it at home in an old, red-covered history of the world, and has looked at it OFTEN.&rdquo;</p><p>To think that Jerry Cowan should have seen such a picture often! We were as deeply impressed as Felix had meant us to be.</p></div> </div>
