<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>an affair of white glass, with a cluster of red glass cherries and golden-green glass leaves on its side, which Aunt Olivia had given Cecily one Christmas.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered Cecily, with a change of tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Felicity quickly. &ldquo;Only, if to-morrow is the last day, the cherry vase won&rsquo;t be much use to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it will be as much use to me as to any one else,&rdquo; said Cecily indignantly. She had sacrificed her dear forget-me-not jug to satisfy some pang of conscience, or propitiate some threatening fate, but surrender her precious cherry vase she could not and would not.
