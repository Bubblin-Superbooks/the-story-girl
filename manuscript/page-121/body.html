It would make Him seem lots more real.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered myself what he looks like,&rdquo; said Felicity in a burst of confidence. Even in Felicity, so it would seem, there were depths of thought unplumbed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of Jesus,&rdquo; said Felix meditatively. &ldquo;He looks just like a man, only better and kinder. But now that I come to think of it, I&rsquo;ve never seen a picture of God.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if there isn&rsquo;t one in Toronto it isn&rsquo;t likely there&rsquo;s one anywhere,&rdquo; said Peter disappointedly. &ldquo;I saw a picture of the devil once,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It was in a book my Aunt Jane had. She got it for a prize in school. My Aunt Jane was clever.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
