<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We felt ashamed ourselves, because we knew people should conduct themselves decently and in order on Sunday farings-forth. But, as with Peter, it &ldquo;had laughed itself.&rdquo;</p><p>Even Felicity laughed. Felicity was not nearly so angry with Peter as might have been expected. She even walked beside him and let him carry her Bible. They talked quite confidentially. Perhaps she forgave him the more easily, because he had justified her in her predictions, and thus afforded her a decided triumph over the Story Girl.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep on going to church,&rdquo; Peter told her. &ldquo;I like it. Sermons are more int&rsquo;resting than I thought, and I like the singing. I wish I could make up my mind whether to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist. I s&rsquo;pose I might ask the ministers about it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
