What are ministers for if they ain&rsquo;t to tell people how to get to heaven?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s all right for grown-ups to ask them things, of course. But it isn&rsquo;t respectful for little boys&mdash;especially hired boys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why. But anyhow, I s&rsquo;pose it wouldn&rsquo;t be much use, because if he was a Presbyterian minister he&rsquo;d say I ought to be a Presbyterian, and if he was a Methodist he&rsquo;d tell me to be one, too. Look here, Felicity, what IS the difference between them?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
