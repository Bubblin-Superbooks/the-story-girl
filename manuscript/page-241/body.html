They&rsquo;d be all mixed up if they hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when I&rsquo;m an angel&mdash;if I ever get to be one&mdash;will my name still be Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ll have a new name up there,&rdquo; said Cecily gently. &ldquo;It says so in the Bible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad of that. Peter would be such a funny name for an angel. And what is the difference between angels and archangels?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, archangels are angels that have been angels so long that they&rsquo;ve had time to grow better and brighter and more beautiful than newer angels,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, who probably made that explanation up on the spur of the moment, just to pacify Peter.</p></div> </div>
