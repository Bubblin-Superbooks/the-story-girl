<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;DEAR PETER:&mdash;I am so very glad and thankful that you are going to get better. We were so afraid you would not last Tuesday, and we felt dreadful, even Felicity. We all prayed for you. I think the others have stopped now, but I keep it up every night still, for fear you might have a relaps. (I don&rsquo;t know if that is spelled right. I haven&rsquo;t the dixonary handy, and if I ask the others Felicity will laugh at me, though she cannot spell lots of words herself.) I am saving some of the Honourable Mr. Whalen&rsquo;s pears for you. I&rsquo;ve got them hid where nobody can find them. There&rsquo;s only a dozen because Dan et all the rest, but I guess you will like them. We have got all the apples picked, and are all ready to take the measles now, if we have to, but I hope we won&rsquo;t.</p></div> </div>
