We were joined on the stairs by Felicity, yawning and rosy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, I overslept myself. Uncle Roger wanted breakfast at six. Well, I suppose the fire is on anyhow, for the Story Girl is up. I guess she got up early to knead the bread.

I got up at three, and it was lovely and light, so I just gave it a right good kneading and popped it into the oven. And it&rsquo;s all done and out of the way.
