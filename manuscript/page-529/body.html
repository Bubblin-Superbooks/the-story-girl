<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One night Cecily came into the pantry with a large cucumber, and proceeded to devour the greater part of it. The grown-ups were away that evening, attending a lecture at Markdale, so we ate our snacks openly, without any recourse to ways that were dark. I remember I supped that night off a solid hunk of fat pork, topped off with a slab of cold plum pudding.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t like cucumber, Cecily,&rdquo; Dan remarked.</p><p>&ldquo;Neither I do,&rdquo; said Cecily with a grimace. &ldquo;But Peter says they&rsquo;re splendid for dreaming. He et one that night he had the dream about being caught by cannibals. I&rsquo;d eat three cucumbers if I could have a dream like that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
